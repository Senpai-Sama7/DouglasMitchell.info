## Quality Gate Failure Responses

### Build Failures
1. **TypeScript Errors**: Fix type issues, verify with `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. **Lint Failures**: Resolve code quality issues, run `npm run lint --fix`
3. **Test Failures**: Debug test issues, ensure all tests pass
4. **Asset Missing**: Verify build process, check file paths

### Performance Issues
1. **Slow Loading**: Optimize assets, reduce payload size
2. **Poor Core Web Vitals**: Address LCP, FID, CLS issues
3. **Large Assets**: Compress images, minify code

### Accessibility Issues
1. **Color Contrast**: Adjust colors to meet AA standards
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Fix focus management
3. **ARIA Issues**: Correct semantic markup
4. **Screen Reader Issues**: Test with assistive technology

### Security Concerns
1. **Vulnerability Found**: Update dependencies immediately
2. **XSS Risk**: Remove innerHTML usage, sanitize inputs
3. **Content Security**: Implement CSP headers
