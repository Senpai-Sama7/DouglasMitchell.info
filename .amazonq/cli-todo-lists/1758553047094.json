README.md claims \"no frameworks, no build, <2KB JS\" but package.json reveals complex Next.js app with GSAP, React, Sanity CMS, Neon DB, and 20+ dependencies. Actual architecture: Next.js 15 with static export, GSAP animations, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, comprehensive testing suite, and production-grade tooling.","**COMPONENT ANALYSIS**: Well-structured component architecture with 11 specialized components. Clean separation of concerns: CustomCursor uses proper event handling and cleanup, layout.tsx implements proper SEO metadata, components follow React best practices with proper TypeScript typing. App Router structure is correctly implemented with proper 'use client' directives.","**BUILD CONFIGURATION**: Excellent configuration setup. TypeScript config uses strict mode with proper path mapping. Next.js config correctly set for static export with optimizations. Playwright config comprehensive with multi-browser testing, mobile viewports, and proper CI integration. ESLint extends Next.js core web vitals with sensible rule overrides. Build tooling is production-ready.","**CODE QUALITY ANALYSIS**: Excellent code patterns throughout. API routes use proper error handling, logging, and performance monitoring. Database layer (neon.ts) implements graceful fallbacks and prevents log spam. TypeScript interfaces are well-defined. Content is properly separated in site-data.ts. Code follows consistent patterns with proper error boundaries and observability. Professional-grade logging and metrics collection implemented.","**SECURITY & PERFORMANCE**: Strong security practices - environment variables properly templated, no hardcoded secrets. Comprehensive accessibility testing with axe-core and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Bundle size monitoring with automated regression detection. Performance monitoring built into API routes. Static export configuration optimizes for CDN delivery. Missing: CSP headers, security headers configuration, and performance budgets in CI.","**AUDIT COMPLETE**: Comprehensive analysis reveals a sophisticated, well-architected Next.js application with excellent code quality, comprehensive testing, and production-ready tooling. Major issue: critical documentation mismatch between README.md and actual implementation. Recommendations: 1) Fix documentation conflict immediately, 2) Add security headers, 3) Implement performance budgets, 4) Add CSP configuration, 5) Consider bundle optimization for GSAP usage."],"modified_files":[],"id":"1758553047094"}
